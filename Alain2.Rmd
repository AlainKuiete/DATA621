8.1. Recreate the simulated data from Exercise 7.2:
```{r}
library(mlbench)
set.seed(200)
simulated <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
simulated <- cbind(simulated$x, simulated$y)
simulated <- as.data.frame(simulated)
colnames(simulated)[ncol(simulated)] <- "y"
```


(a) Fit a random forest model to all of the predictors, then estimate the
variable importance scores:
```{r}
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
model1 <- randomForest(y ~ ., data = simulated,
importance = TRUE,
ntree = 1000)
rfImp1 <- varImp(model1, scale = FALSE)
```

```{r}
rfImp1 
```


Did the random forest model significantly use the uninformative predic-
tors ( V6 â€“ V10 )?


(b) Now add an additional predictor that is highly correlated with one of the
informative predictors. For example:
```{r}
simulated$duplicate1 <- simulated$V1 + rnorm(200) * .1
cor(simulated$duplicate1, simulated$V1)
```

Fit another random forest model to these data. Did the importance score
for V1 change? What happens when you add another predictor that is
also highly correlated with V1 ?


(c) Use the cforest function in the party package to fit a random forest model
using conditional inference trees. The party package function varimp can
calculate predictor importance. The conditional argument of that func-
tion toggles between the traditional importance measure and the modified
version described in Strobl et al. (2007). Do these importances show the
same pattern as the traditional random forest model?


(d) Repeat this process with different tree models, such as boosted trees and
Cubist. Does the same pattern occur?8.8 Computing
